okay now i'll elaborate more on my html structure. because for some layout issues, i can't exactly change my html structure to match yours. 

i've done what i can but there's still some functioning problems.

my html structure goes like this:

div id="approveContainer", that's the outer most div for approving, 
and firstly in the approvecontainer div i have div id="selectApproveTypes", that's for the selection of the 3 types of approving, which are:
Type 1: construction fee only.
Type 2: including equipment fee.
Type 3: equipment fee only.
In the selectApproveTypes i have 3 radiobuttons for the actual action of selecting the types of approving. that's it for the selectApproveTypes div.

for each type there are 3 kinds of texts that are used for approving funds, which are:
Kind 1: Both petition and Letter.
Kind 2: Petition only.
Kind 3: Letter only.
Therefore secondly, in the same layer with selectApproveTypes, i also have selectApproveType1Kinds, selectApproveType2Kinds, selectApproveType3Kinds, and those are for the selection of the specific kinds of the selected types of approval. for example, if i want to approve with the first type (construction fee only), using the third kind of the text (letter only), i would go selectApproveTypes and check the radiobutton for approveType1. then, my js code then shows the selectApproveType1Kinds div, and then i can check the radio button for the 3rd kind of the first type, which is choosing the letter only option for the construction fee only situation. 

thirdly, also in the same layer with selectApproveTypes, selectApproveType1Kinds, selectApproveType2Kinds, and selectApproveType3Kinds, i also have about 12 divs that are for the user to fill in the information that are going to be used in the result text. 
And those divs are:
approveType1BothPAndLPContent
approveType1BothPAndLLContent
approveType1PetitionContent
approveType1LetterContent
approveType2BothPAndLPContent
approveType2BothPAndLLContent
approveType2PetitionContent
approveType2LetterContent
approveType3BothPAndLPContent
approveType3BothPAndLLContent
approveType3PetitionContent
approveType3LetterContent
in those divs, i each div's key inputs and conditions. and that's where i think the “An invalid form control with name='' is not focusable” situation occurs. because in the key inputs and conditions, there are a lot of text inputs that are required to be filled in, but at the same time, if only a specific content div is being shown, which is what happens due to my js code setting, filling out other required text input would be unnecessary, and that's where the toggle function that you provided would come in use.

so my question is: based on the knowledge of my html structure, can you help integrate the toggle function to my situation?
